# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a Deep Learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model learns to recognize digits (0–9) from 28x28 grayscale images.

It demonstrates a complete deep learning workflow including data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
